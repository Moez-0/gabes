      "paragraph1": "Gabes, Tunisia is facing an unprecedented environmental and health emergency. The state-owned Chemical Group of Tunisia (GCT) phosphate-processing plant has been poisoning the city for decades, causing severe air and water pollution.",
      "paragraph2": "In October 2025, a major gas leak sent over 120 people to hospitals, including children who developed paralysis. Residents report increased respiratory problems, cancer rates, and chronic health conditions linked to the toxic emissions.",
      "paragraph3": "The plant processes raw phosphate into fertilizer, discharging toxic waste directly into the Gulf of Gabes—one of the most polluted sites in the Mediterranean. This pollution has devastated marine life, turned waters dark, and destroyed the livelihoods of local fishermen.",
      "paragraph4": "Despite government promises to relocate or modernize the plant, no meaningful action has been taken. Tunisia's National Observatory for Agriculture has repeatedly warned that air quality in Gabes exceeds WHO limits, with dangerous levels of sulfur dioxide and ammonia.",
      "quote": "Our entire lives have been ruined by the smells and smoke we inhale every day. We want this complex dismantled, and we will not stop until it happens.",
